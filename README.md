Profile to work with YourControls application and MSFS2020. If you find any bugs, please contact me on YourControls Discord: Dkgolfnut_Dennis

Known Issues:

 - I have disconnected the following items on the CLIPBOARD due to conflicts so Each pilot will need to control the items separately. 
 - ENTRY DOOR, PARATROOP LEFT/RIGHT DOORS, RAMP
 - FORMATION LIGHTS KNOB is not synchronizing properly. You will both have to adjust as you see fit.
 - AP MASTER SWITCH WILL NOT SYNCHRONIZE when turning ON and will have to be turned on manually by each pilot. I do have code to turn it off and that is synchronized.

FIXED: 9-1-2024 Released

SEP 1, 2024
    # - Fixed AP MASTER SWITCH Synch for turning OFF. Still no solution yet for truning it ON synchronized
AUG 31, 2024
    # - Fixed numerous toggle switches, Valves, and light switches/dimmers
    # - Removed ENTRY DOOR, PARATROOP LEFT/RIGHT DOORS, RAMP from Clipboard sync due to impact on doors continmually opening and closing

I recommend that you and your co-pilot first conduct a test flight to check if everything is working properly.
